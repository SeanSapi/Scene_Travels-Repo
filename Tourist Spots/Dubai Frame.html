                    The Dubai Frame is an architectural landmark in Zabeel Park, Dubai. It holds the record for the largest frame in the world. Whilst described by The Guardian newspaper as "the biggest picture frame on the planet,” it is also controversial as the "biggest stolen building of all time.”
                    The project was conceived by Fernando Donis, and selected as the winner of a design competition by the Government of Dubai. The designer has alleged that he had his intellectual property stolen and was denied credit for the design.
