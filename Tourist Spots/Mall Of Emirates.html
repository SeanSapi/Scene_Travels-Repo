                    The project was launched in October 2003 at an estimated cost of AED 800 million (US$218 million) and was scheduled to be completed in September 2005. The architecture in the three-story complex combines Arabic and Mediterranean elements, with each level connected to a car park.
                    The mall was designed by the American architectural firm F+A Architects. The main building contract was handled by Khansaheb, while the Ski Dubai contract was given to Pomagalski. The chair lifts in the snow park and the structural steelworks were handled by Emirates Building System and the piling by Bauer.
                    The mall opened for business on 28 September 2005 with an official inauguration in November.
