                <p class="w3-large">It was in 1816 that Sheikh Al Nuaimi and his small band of followers defeated the Al Bu Shamis tribe in conflict to capture the coastal settlement of Ajman. They also captured the Ajman Fort soon after and established the Nuaimi rule, who continue to be the ruling UAE family in the Emirate.   </p>

                <p class="w3-large">The 18th-century fort was once a mainstay for the Ajman ruling family. It also acted as the first line of defense against any potential invaders and attackers.</p>

                <p class="w3-large">From 1970 to 1978, the fort was also used as a police station. The museum still contains relics of this period as well. </p>

                <p class="w3-large">
                    It was in 1981 that Ajman Fort finally became a museum. So as you can see, Ajman Museum's history is as fascinating as the artifacts it holds.

                <p class="w3-text-black">
                    As you enter the museum, one of the most impressive displays is that of an excavated cemetery that features pottery and funeral jewelry from as old as 3000 BC. The cemetery was discovered in the Al Mowaihat area. This site is the emirate’s earliest human settlement.

                <p class="w3-text-black">
                    Moreover, since fishing was also a staple of the old Ajman, one can find an entire section dedicated to exhibits of pearl fishing in the museum.
                </p><br>

                <p class="w3-text-black">
                    There are several other replicas of traditional life located around the museum. You will be fascinated by the attention to detail, which makes the figurines so realistic that you can easily forget you’re standing in a well-constructed mock-up.
